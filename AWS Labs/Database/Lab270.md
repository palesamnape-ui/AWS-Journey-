# AWS Lab: Selecting Data from a Database (SQL SELECT Queries) 270

## Overview

Welcome to this project repository! This lab documents my completion of an **AWS database fundamentals lab focused on querying relational data using SQL**.

In this exercise, I connected to a preconfigured database environment hosted on an **Amazon EC2 Command Host** and queried a relational database named **`world`**. Using the `SELECT` statement, comparison operators, and aggregate functions, I retrieved and filtered data across multiple tables.

## The Lab Objectives

After completing this lab, I was able to:

* Connect to a database instance from an EC2 Command Host
* Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve data
* Apply the `COUNT()` function
* Filter results using `WHERE`, comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `=`), and logical operators (`AND`)
* Sort query results using `ORDER BY`

## ⚙️ Execution Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Accessing the AWS Lab Environment

I launched the lab by selecting **Start Lab** and waited until the lab status showed **Ready**. Once the environment was provisioned, I opened the **AWS Management Console**, which automatically logged me into the temporary lab account.

### Step 2: Connecting to the Command Host

From the AWS Management Console, I navigated to **EC2 → Instances** and located the instance labeled **Command Host**. Using **Session Manager**, I connected to the instance without requiring SSH keys.

Once connected, I elevated privileges and navigated to the appropriate working directory:

### Step 3: Connecting to the MySQL Database

From the Command Host terminal, I connected to the MySQL database server using the provided credentials. The database named **`world`** was already provisioned and contained three tables:

* `city`
* `country`
* `countrylanguage`
