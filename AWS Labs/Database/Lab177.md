## Welcome to the AWS Lambda Exercise!

In this challenge, I’m excited to guide you through creating an AWS Lambda function that counts the number of words in a text file. It’s a great way to get hands-on with AWS, and I believe you’ll find it rewarding!

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Create a Lambda function to count the number of words in a text file.
- Configure an Amazon S3 bucket to automatically invoke your Lambda function when a text file is uploaded.
- Set up an Amazon SNS topic to report the word count via email.

## Time Required

This lab will take you about **90 minutes** to complete. Let’s dive in!

## Launch Your Lab Environment

1. At the top of these instructions, click **Start Lab** to begin.
2. A panel will pop up showing the lab status.
3. Wait for the message **"Lab status: ready"** to appear, then click **X** to close the panel.

This lab will create a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) account for you to work on your Lambda function and the resources you'll need.

## Your Challenge

Here’s what you need to do to create the Lambda function:

1. **Develop the Lambda Function**:
   - Use the AWS Management Console to create a Lambda function in Python and set up the necessary resources.

2. **Send the Word Count**:
   - Use an SNS topic to email the word count. If you want, you can also send it as an SMS!
   - Format the response like this:
     ```
     The word count in the <textFileName> file is nnn.
     ```
     Just replace `<textFileName>` with the actual file name.

3. **Set the Email Subject**:
   - Use **Word Count Result** as the subject line of your email.

4. **Automate the Invocation**:
   - Make sure your function is automatically triggered when a text file is uploaded to your S3 bucket.

5. **Testing**:
   - Upload a few sample text files with different word counts to test your function.
   - Once you’ve tested it, forward the email you receive and take a screenshot of your Lambda function to share with your instructor.

## Helpful Hints

- Ensure all your resources are created in the same AWS Region for consistency.
- You’ll need an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for your Lambda function to access other AWS services. Since we can’t create a new IAM role in this lab, use the `LambdaAccessRole`. This role provides the following permissions:
  - **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole**: Grants write permissions to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
  - **AmazonSNSFullAccess**: Gives full access to Amazon SNS via the AWS Management Console.
  - **AmazonS3FullAccess**: Allows full access to all S3 buckets.
  - **CloudWatchFullAccess**: Provides full access to Amazon CloudWatch.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! 🎉 You’ve now successfully:
- Created a Lambda function to count the number of words in a text file.
- Configured an S3 bucket to invoke your Lambda function when a text file is uploaded.
- Set up an SNS topic to report the word count via email.
